SonarFT: System Oscillator for Navigation and Ranging in Financial Trade

Version: 1.0.0.0

Initial Date: March 18, 2023

Last Update: July 2025

## Overview

SonarFT, an acronym for "System Oscillator for Navigation and Ranging in Financial Trade," draws inspiration from the SONAR technology used in navigation and underwater detection. It signifies a tool designed to monitor market oscillations and trends with the aim of identifying promising trading opportunities.

The term 'FT' stands for "Financial Trade," thereby emphasizing the application's purpose.

Consequently, SonarFT serves as a dynamic system for tracking and analyzing market oscillations and trends to discover profitable trading opportunities.

A system oscillator, in broad terms, refers to a device or component that generates a periodic or oscillating signal. In electronic and communication systems, oscillators are used to create waveforms such as sine waves, square waves, or other types of periodic signals. These signals serve various purposes, including synchronization, timing, frequency generation, and modulation.

Within the realm of finance or financial trading, a system oscillator might represent a tool or algorithm that generates a signal based on market data and trends. This signal aids in identifying market fluctuations, trends, or patterns that could be pivotal for trading decisions. Financial oscillators, capable of analyzing historical data or real-time market information, play a critical role in technical analysis and automated trading systems. Commonly employed financial oscillators include the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Stochastic Oscillator.

SonarFT is a versatile trading bot, suitable for both multi-market, cross-exchange trading as well as single-exchange trading. It persistently tracks and analyzes market oscillations and trends to detect trading opportunities, consequently generating a trade packet for execution and profit generation.

## SonarFT Development Structure, Usage and Mechanisms

### Structure

SonarFT employs a modular architecture, diligently incorporating design patterns and clean coding principles. Utilizing the Python language and encapsulating the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, it manifests classes assigned with distinct responsibilities. For clarity and easy maintenance, each class is preserved in a separate file, thereby promoting a structure that is coherent, manageable, and easily modifiable.

The present structure of SonarFT incorporates 14 Python classes across 12 dedicated files.

The classes are organized into the following layers:

**Initiator Classes** : Initiation is the starting point of any operation. These classes are the genesis of a bot's lifecycle, tasked with initializing a bot instance, bootstrapping necessary parameters and configurations, and setting the stage for the execution of the selected strategy. (`SonarftServer`, `BotManager`, `SonarftBot`)

**Strategy Classes** : Strategy forms the heart of any trading operation. In SonarFT, these classes play a central role by encapsulating specific trading strategies. They embody the decision-making logic that drives the bot's trading behavior. (`SonarftSearch`, `TradeProcessor`, `TradeValidator`, `TradeExecutor`)

**Strategy Support Classes** : Support is the backbone of any effective system. These classes provide essential utility and calculation functions that aid in implementing the trading strategies. They supply necessary inputs and perform ancillary tasks to support the primary strategy operations. (`SonarftPrices`, `SonarftIndicators`, `SonarftMath`)

**API Management Classes** : Smooth interaction with external systems is crucial in trading. These classes manage all API communication aspects, including sending requests, handling responses, and managing data. They serve as the link between SonarFT and the outside world, particularly the trading platforms. (`SonarftApiManager`)

**General Helper Classes** : These classes are the multitaskers of SonarFT. They perform a variety of functions that assist in the overall functioning of the bot. From data formatting to logging activities, they fill in the gaps in the bot's operational framework. (`SonarftExecution`, `SonarftValidators`, `SonarftHelpers`)

### Usage

#### Installing Dependencies

```shell
~/sonarft$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Launching the Bot

To run the server directly with Python:

```shell
~/sonarft$ python sonarft.py
```

To execute the compiled SonarFT binary (Linux):

```shell
~/sonarft$ ./dist/sonarft/sonarft
```

#### Configuring Parameters and Settings

Initial parameters and configurations are defined in these files: `config_parameters.json`, `config_exchanges.json`, `config_symbols.json`, `config_fees.json`, `config_indicators.json`, `config_markets.json` and `config.json`.

To customize your configuration, either select an existing configuration from `config.json` or create your own within that file.

The default `config_1` uses the following files: `parameters_1` (parameters_setup = 1), `exchanges_1` (exchanges_setup = 1), `symbols_1` (symbols_setup = 1), `indicators_1` (indicators_setup = 1), and `exchanges_fees_1` (fees_setup = 1).

For example, to use a different configuration:

```shell
~/sonarft$ ./dist/sonarft/sonarft -c config_2

~/sonarft$ ./dist/sonarft/sonarft -c config_10
```

Note: Use the `-c` (`--config`) flag before specifying the configuration.

To create a new configuration, refer to each configuration file for available options. To add a new exchange, symbol, parameters, or fees, simply include them in their respective files. Subsequently, create the new configuration in `config.json`.

Key default parameters (`config_parameters.json`):

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `profit_percentage_threshold` | 0.0001 | Minimum profit percentage (0.01%) required to execute a trade |
| `trade_amount` | 1 | Trade amount in base currency units |
| `is_simulating_trade` | 1 | Simulation mode on by default — no real orders are placed |

#### Modifying the API

Change the default API by running the bot with the `-l` (`--library`) flag.

```shell
~/sonarft$ ./dist/sonarft/sonarft -c config_2 -l ccxt
```

The ccxt API uses REST technology for communication, unlike the default WebSocket (ccxtpro). Although WebSocket is faster and lower latency, it's not available for all supported exchanges.

Note: You can run multiple instances of the bot concurrently. Each instance is a separate bot with its own states and behaviors, defined by its classes. These classes act as "blueprints" for the creation of objects.

#### REST API Endpoints

The SonarFT server exposes the following HTTP endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/botids/{client_id}` | List all bot IDs associated with a client |
| GET | `/default_parameters` | Retrieve default trading parameters |
| GET | `/default_indicators` | Retrieve default indicator settings |
| GET | `/bot/get_parameters/{client_id}` | Get per-client trading parameters |
| POST | `/bot/set_parameters/{client_id}` | Update per-client trading parameters |
| GET | `/bot/get_indicators/{client_id}` | Get per-client indicator settings |
| POST | `/bot/set_indicators/{client_id}` | Update per-client indicator settings |
| GET | `/bot/{botid}/orders` | Retrieve order history for a bot |
| GET | `/bot/{botid}/trades` | Retrieve trade history for a bot |

WebSocket connections are handled at `/ws/{client_id}`. Supported WebSocket actions: `create`, `run`, `remove`.

#### Docker Deployment

Build and run with Docker Compose (includes Traefik reverse proxy with TLS):

```shell
~/sonarft$ docker build -t sonarft:latest .
~/sonarft$ docker-compose up
```

The bot is served on port 5000, routed through Traefik at `sonarft.com`. The Traefik dashboard is available at `monitor.sonarft.com:8080`.

### Core Mechanisms

SonarFT Bot operates through a systematic process comprising several key steps, all designed to optimize trading performance. Below are the initial three steps, which lay the groundwork for the bot's trading operations:

1. **Setting Initial Trading Prices** : The first step involves the bot establishing the bid (buy) and ask (sell) prices for the trading asset. These prices form the basis of the bot's trading operations.
2. **Adjusting trading prices** : Once the bid and ask prices have been established, the bot then adjusts these prices to maximise potential profits. This adjustment also aims to keep the prices within a realistic range that allows effective execution of buy and sell orders on the trading platform.
3. **Validating the price difference and covering trading fees** : In the final preparatory step, the bot calculates the price differential between the adjusted bid and ask prices. This calculation aims to verify that the margin is sufficient to cover the trading fees associated with both buying and selling. This step is critical in preventing the execution of trades that would not yield a net profit once trading fees are accounted for.

#### Establishing Initial Trading Prices

Formulating the initial bid and ask prices is a strategic task heavily reliant on the order book's data. This crucial process aids in optimally positioning the trading bot within a feasible and profitable price range. The process proceeds as follows:

Initially, bid (buy) and ask (sell) prices are determined by calculating the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) for a specified depth of orders in the order book. The VWAP is computed by multiplying each order's price by its corresponding volume within the defined depth, followed by the computation of the average of these values. This method yields a price that takes into account not only the quantity but also the volume of orders, creating a more representative average price.

For calculating the VWAP for the buy side, data from the bid side of the order book, encompassing all current buy orders and their prices, is utilized. Similarly, the ask side of the order book, containing all current sell orders and their prices, is used for the sell side.

This method ensures that the trading bot begins operations within a price range that aligns with the prevailing market conditions and volume. This strategic positioning enhances its ability to identify and seize profitable trading opportunities.

```python
def get_weighted_prices(self, depth: int, order_book: Dict) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Calculate the volume-weighted average buy (bid) and sell (ask) prices.

    Parameters:
    depth (int): Depth of the order book to consider for the calculation.
    order_book (Dict): A dictionary containing 'bids' and 'asks' information.

    Returns:
    Tuple[float, float]: The volume-weighted average bid price and ask price.
    """

    bids = order_book['bids'][:depth]
    asks = order_book['asks'][:depth]

    # Calculate the total bid volume and volume-weighted bid price
    total_bid_volume = sum(volume for _, volume in bids)
    bid_vwap = sum(price * volume for price, volume in bids) / total_bid_volume

    # Calculate the total ask volume and volume-weighted ask price
    total_ask_volume = sum(volume for _, volume in asks)
    ask_vwap = sum(price * volume for price, volume in asks) / total_ask_volume

    return bid_vwap, ask_vwap
```

In the Python function provided above, the volume-weighted average buy (bid) and sell (ask) prices are calculated. This function is fundamental for the initialization of trading prices.

#### Adjusting Trading Prices

Once the initial prices have been set, the next crucial step is to adjust the prices. The purpose of this adjustment is to increase the profitability potential of the trading bot while ensuring that the adjusted prices remain within a reasonable range for the execution of buy and sell orders.

The price adjustment process (`weighted_adjust_prices`) takes into account a comprehensive set of market dynamics:

- **Market direction** — determined via Simple Moving Average (SMA) or Exponential Moving Average (EMA), returning `'bull'`, `'bear'`, or `'neutral'`
- **Short-term market trend** — calculated from recent OHLCV close price changes over a configurable window
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** — identifies overbought (≥ 70) and oversold (≤ 30) conditions
- **Stochastic RSI** — provides %K and %D crossover signals to refine entry/exit timing
- **MACD** — used in dynamic volatility adjustment to weight the influence of trend signals
- **Volatility** — computed from order book mid-price standard deviation, then scaled by a dynamic adjustment factor
- **Support and resistance levels** — derived from historical high/low prices; adjusted prices are clamped within these bounds
- **Spread factors** — a spread increase factor and spread decrease factor are applied based on the combined bull/bear direction and trend signals to widen or narrow the bid/ask spread for profit capture

The final adjusted prices are computed as a weighted blend of the target VWAP price and the current order book weighted price, with the weight determined by volatility and market strength.

#### Validating the Price Difference and Covering Trading Fees

After price adjustment, it is necessary to validate the profitability potential of the set prices. Specifically, we need to ensure that the difference between the adjusted buy and sell prices is sufficient to cover the trading fees on both sides of the transaction.

Trading fees, which are inherent in all trading platforms, must be taken into account to ensure that the bot's activities result in a net positive return. This validation step aims to avoid transactions where the trading fees incurred outweigh the profit potential, thereby preventing the bot from engaging in unprofitable trades.

Fee and profit calculations are performed by `SonarftMath.calculate_trade`, which applies per-exchange precision rules (defined in `EXCHANGE_RULES`) for price rounding, amount rounding, and fee calculation. Supported exchanges include `okx`, `bitfinex`, and `binance`.

#### Trade Validation and Execution

Before a trade is executed, `TradeValidator` performs two additional checks in parallel:

1. **Liquidity depth verification** — confirms the order book on both the buy and sell exchanges has sufficient depth and volume to absorb the trade amount without excessive slippage
2. **Spread threshold verification** — computes a dynamic spread threshold based on historical data and current volatility classification (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`), and verifies the current spread ratio falls within acceptable bounds

If all validations pass, `TradeExecutor` dispatches the trade asynchronously via `SonarftExecution`, which determines the trade position (`LONG` or `SHORT`) based on market direction and RSI/StochRSI signals, then places limit orders on the respective exchanges. In simulation mode (`is_simulating_trade = 1`), no real orders are placed — order IDs and amounts are generated synthetically.

Trade and order history are persisted to `sonarftdata/history/{botid}_orders.json` and `sonarftdata/history/{botid}_trades.json`.

These steps lay the groundwork for the SonarFT bot to function effectively, respond to market changes, execute trades profitably and ensure that it operates within a range suitable for its trading strategy.
